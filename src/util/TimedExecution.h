/**
 * TimedExecution class.
 *
 * Is initalized with a function pointer which manages time, which can only be
 * executed if a certain timeout has passed.
 *
 * This does NOT execute the function every N milliseconds, but functions as
 * guard against being executed more often than that.
 *
 * It can be configured to only be executed a certain number of times,
 * at which isDone() will return true.
 *
 * Note: Passing on function pointers that modifies the instance should be done
 *   with great care with multi-threading. If all you want to do is protect
 *   a function with a timer, wrap it inside this an instance of this class.
 *
 * TODO swarminglogic, 2013-09-21: option to accumulate execution.
 *    You then need to maintain a uint leftOverTime.
 *    Note then: leftOverTime = timer_.getTicks() % timeout.
 *    "If timeout is x, and 3x has passed, it performs exec() until
 *     accumulation falls below threshold."
